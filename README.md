# 365-Day CN & Cybersecurity Challenge

Welcome to the **365-Day CN & Cybersecurity Challenge**! 🎯

Over the next year, this repo is your companion for a daily deep‐dive into:

- **Computer Networks**  
  – OSI/TCP-IP layers, routing & switching, protocols (HTTP, TCP/UDP, DNS), subnetting, SDN, IPv6, QoS, and more.

- **Cybersecurity**  
  – Threat modeling, encryption, pentesting (Kali, Metasploit), web-app security (OWASP Top 10), network defense (firewalls, IDS/IPS), ethical hacking exercises, and incident response.

### How to Use

1. 🗓️ **Daily Folder:**  
   Each day gets its own folder (`/day-001`, `/day-002`, …) containing:
   - **Notes** (.md) with theory & diagrams  
   - **Labs** (scripts, configs, packet captures)  
   - **Resources** (links to articles, videos, docs)

2. 🚀 **Hands-On Challenges:**  
   Try the “Challenge” file in each day’s folder—capture-the-flag puzzles, mini-projects, or quizzes.

3. 📢 **Share Your Progress:**  
   Pull requests are welcome! Got a better lab script or concise cheatsheet? Fork & PR.

4. 📖 **Weekly Recap:**  
   Every Sunday, find a `/weekly-recaps` markdown summarizing key takeaways and further reading.
